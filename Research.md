The research interest of the lab has coalesced around a desire to understand the neural circuit mechanisms of animal behavior and cognition. We use *in vivo* electrophysiology as a primary tool, combined with complex behavioral tasks, optogenetics, and computational tools, to map neural dynamics embedded in the neural population activities – primarily in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus – to the hidden cognitive variables that underlie learning, memory, and decision-making. We also have a great interest in how these neural representations and their behavioral functions would be altered in neuropsychiatric disease conditions such as addiction, depression, and schizophrenia.
