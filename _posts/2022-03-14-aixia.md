Aixia gave a talk today at the weekly CIBR Internal Seminar Series. The title of her talk was 'A New Thought on Orbitofrontal Cortex'. During the presentation, she proposed an alternative explanation for the lack of devaluation effect caused by OFC lesions and a new hypothesis that she will test with a set of new experiments.
