This lab website has been created by using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme on the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Our lab at the Chinese Institute for Brain Research (CIBR), located in Beijing, will be launched on June 1st, 2022! The new lab will be working on the neural circuit mechanisms of associative learning and decision-making using various behavioral and systems neuroscience approaches in rodents(i.e., rats and mice). Welcome to join us!
