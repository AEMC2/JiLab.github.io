Jingfeng Zhou is thrilled to accept an offered position as an Assistant Investigator at the Chinese Institute for Brain Research (CIBR), Beijing. The Zhou lab will study the neural circuit mechanisms of animal behavior and cognition, with a focus on how abstract knowledge is learned and organized in the rat brain and how such knowledge would affect learning and decision-making in new situations.

The Zhou Lab is expected to be launched in the summer of 2021.
