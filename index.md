Welcome to the Zhou Lab of Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience at the Chinese Institute for Brain Research, Beijing. We study neural circuit mechanisms of animal behavior and cognition. On this website, you can get to know [who we are](People.md) and [what we do](Research.md), check out the [publications](Publications.md) and [news](News.md) for the latest updates, or explore useful [resources](Resources.md), [fun stuff](Fun.md), and possible [positions](Join.md) in the lab.

Note: Jingfeng Zhou, Ph.D. is currently a postdoc at the National Institute on Drug Abuse Intramural Research Program (NIDA-IRP), which is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He has accepted an offer as a Principal Investigator at the Chinese Institute for Brain Research (CIBR), Beijing. This lab website will be in use after he officially starts his lab, hopefully, this summer after his visiting postdoctoral fellow program at NIDA IRP ends in July.
