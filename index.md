Welcome to Zhou Lab at the [Chinese Institute for Brain Research (CIBR), Beijing](http://cibr.ac.cn/#/). We study how brain cell activity controls **associative learning and decision-making** in rats and mice, with a belief that our animal research provides insight into how the human brain operates. On this website, you can get to know [who we are](People.md) and [what we do](Research.md), check out the [publications](Publications.md) and [news](News.md) for the latest updates, or explore useful [resources](Resources.md), [fun stuff](Fun.md), and possible [positions](Join.md) in the lab.
